# Project 1
#### **Question 1**: 

A Python package is a collection of executable modules and functions under a common namespace, indicated by the `.` used to call it. A library, on the other hand, is a collection of packages that may be imported into a file-- however, there may also be a library of functions inside a package that indicates a collection of functions rather than a collection of packages. 

Using a package and its library of functions requires that the user first install the package by importing it:

   `import pandas as pd`
   
   `import numpy`
   
Later, the user can call a function from the package's function library as though the function were created by the user, as long as the user specifies which package the function comes from.

   `example = pd.head()`
   
The `pd.` tells the computer to look for the function `head()` in the pandas package, which was imported under the alias `pd` above. 
If no alias had been given, the user would call it by its full name.

   `example = numpy.array(some_argument)`
   
As you can see, importing the package under an alias allows the user to access the functions inside it moore quickly and cleanly (as long as the alias is easy to remember!). 
Alii are especially helpful when using the package repeatedly!

#### **Question 2**: 
(1) **Describe what is a data frame? Identify a library of functions that is particularly useful for working with data frames. 

A dataframe is a (typically two-dimensional) data structure that organizes and allows clear presentation of a data set. In Python, the pandas package offers tools to process and analyze data by creating dataframes from data sets that may be either imported or created. 

(2) **In order to read a file in its remote location within the file system of your operating system, which command would you use? Provide an example of how to read a file and import it into your work session in order to create a new data frame.**

pandas has a useful function `read_csv()` that allows a user to import the contents of an external file. It takes as an argument the path of the file to be imported, and may take an additional argument specifying the type of file if it is not a `.csv` extension. 

So, to import the file `my_data.csv` into the file in which I'm working, I would call the `read_csv()` function in pandas and pass the file path as an argument. Here, I will assume that `my_data.csv` is in the same directory as my current file and so I don't need to supply the full path.

~~~~
   import pandas as pd
   
   imported_data = pd.read_csv('my_data.csv')
~~~~

(3) **Also, describe why specifying an argument within a read_() function can be significant. Does data that is saved as a file in a different type of format require a particular argument in order for a data frame to be successfully imported? 

If the file `my_data.csv` had instead been `my_data.tsv` indicating values separated by tabs instead of commas, I would need to pass in the argument `sep=` to tell the function 
to look for tabs. 

~~~~
   import pandas as pd
   
   imported_data = pd.read_csv('my_data.tsv', sep=`\t`)
~~~~

(4) **Also, provide an example that describes a data frame you created. 

(5) **How do you determine how many rows and columns are in a data frame?

(6) **Is there an alternate terminology for describing rows and columns?


#### **Question 3**: 
Import the gapminder.tsv data set and create a new data frame. Interrogate and describe the year variable within the data frame you created. 
Does this variable exhibit regular intervals? 
If you were to add new outcomes to the raw data in order to update and make it more current, which years would you add to each subset of observations? 

Stretch goal: can you identify how many new outcomes in total you would be adding to your data frame?

The year variable contains the years for which data (population, life expectancy, GDP, etc) was recorded. A brief analysis of the years shows that data was recorded every five years, starting from 1952 and ending in 2007. In order to update the data to 2021, we would add two more entries after 2007, one in 2012 and one in 2017. 

#### **Question 4**: 
Using the data frame you created by importing the gapminder.tsv data set, determine which country at what point in time had the lowest life expectancy. Conduct a cursory level investigation as to why this was the case and provide a brief explanation in support of your explanation.

The lowest recorded life expetancy is from Rwanda in 1992, when it was just over 23 years old. This was possibly due to civil unrest and widespread violence-- in 1992, Rwanda was in the middle of a civil war that ended in the Rwandan genocide of 1994. 

#### **Question 5**: 
Using the data frame you created by importing the gapminder.tsv data set, multiply the variable pop by the variable gdpPercap and assign the results to a newly created variable. Then subset and order from highest to lowest the results for Germany, France, Italy and Spain in 2007. Create a table that illustrates your results (you are welcome to either create a table in markdown or plot/save in PyCharm and upload the image). 

Stretch goal: which of the four European countries exhibited the most significant increase in total gross domestic product during the previous 5-year period (to 2007)?





#### **Question 6**: 
You have been introduced to four logical operators thus far: &, ==, | and ^. Describe each one including its purpose and function. Provide an example of how each might be used in the context of programming.

- **&** 'and' operator: 
- **==** indicates equivalence: returns True if two objects are equivalent, and False if they are not. 
   For ints, the '==' operator compares values. 
   
   ~~~~     
           a = 6
           b = (a==6) 
   ~~~~
       
    `b` is now True. If `a` were set equal to any other number, `b` would be False.
    For strings, this logical operator would compare character-by-character.
    
    ~~~~
           string = 'Morgan'
           a = string=='Morgan' # a is True.
           b = string=='morgan' # b is False.
           c = string=='bubble' # c is also False.
    ~~~~
        
- **|** inclusive or: 
- **^** exclusive or:

#### **Question 7**: 
Describe the difference between .loc and .iloc. Provide an example of how to extract a series of consecutive observations from a data frame. Stretch goal: provide an example of how to extract all observations from a series of consecutive columns.

#### **Question 8**: 
Describe how an api works. Provide an example of how to construct a request to a remote server in order to pull data, write it to a local file and then import it to your current work session.

#### **Question 9**: 
Describe the apply() function from the pandas library. What is its purpose? Using apply) to various class objects is an alternative (potentially preferable approach) to writing what other type of command? Why do you think apply() could be a preferred approach?

#### **Question 10**: 
Also describe an alternative approach to filtering the number of columns in a data frame. Instead of using .iloc, what other approach might be used to select, filter and assign a subset number of variables to a new data frame?
